<hr>
Your job is to do the 600 point problem from Topcoder SRM 626, D1.  Here is the
<a href=http://community.topcoder.com/stat?c=problem_statement&pm=13218&rd=15859>Problem Statement.</a>.  You don't have to do it topcoder-style (although you can do that to help you test).
Instead, you need to read each set of parameters on standard input, each on its own 
line.  
<p>
Since Topcoder's servers sometimes go down, here's a description of the problem tailored to 
how the lab is done:
<UL>
<LI> You are given a directed, weighted graph with <b>N</b> nodes and <b>E</b> edges.
<LI> The nodes are numbered from 1 to <b>N</b>.
<LI> There may be up do 2500 edges.  There may be multi-edges and self-loops.
<LI> The graph is given to you by 5 parameters, each on a separate line of standard input.
<LI> Parameter #1 is <b>N</b>, which is a number between 1 and 50.
<LI> Parameter #2 is a vector with <b>E</b> node numbers.  It is called <b>from</b> .
<LI> Parameter #3 is a vector with <b>E</b> node numbers.  It is called <b>to</b> .
<LI> Parameter #4 is a vector with <b>E</b> edge weights.  It is called <b>weights</b>.
<LI> The weights are numbers between 0 and 100,000.
<LI> Parameter #5 is a number between 0 and 1,000,000,000, called <b>charges</b>.
<LI> It should be pretty clear that edge <i>i</i> goes from node 
<b>from[i]</b> 
to node
<b>to[i]</b> 
with weight
<b>weight[i]</b>.
<LI> You want to travel from node 1 to node <b>N</b> by traveling along edges.
<LI> The cost of your journey is the sum of the edge weights that you travel along, and
you want to minimize the cost of your journey.
<LI> Your travels can involve cycles if you want -- you can visit nodes and edges as
     many times as you'd like.
<LI> When you are traveling, you may use a "charge", which negates the edge's weight when
    you travel along it.  
<LI> You can use a total of <b>charges</b> charges.
<LI> Return the minimum cost of your journey.  It should be a <b>long long</b>.
</UL>

I have the examples in text files in the lab directory.  You can see their answers
below. Comments on the examples:

<UL>
<LI> Example 0: The optimal path is [1,2,3], using the charge on the edge from 2 to 3.
<LI> Example 1: The graph may contain self-loops, so you use the loop 100000 times, applying
the charge each time.
<LI> Example 2: When you have two edges between a pair of nodes, you may want to use one of them
     without a charge and one of them with a charge.
<LI> Example 3: When the graph doesn't have cycles, you may not be able to use all of the
     charges.
</UL>

So you can see the format of the input, here's example 0:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>cat Example-0.txt</b></font>
3
1 1 2  2 3 3
2 3 1  3 1 2
1 5 1 10 1 1
1
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 < Example-0.txt</b></font>
-9
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

I have the rest of the topcoder examples in the lab directory as well:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 < Example-1.txt</b></font>
-10000000
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 < Example-2.txt</b></font>
-9
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 < Example-3.txt</b></font>
-98765
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 < Example-4.txt</b></font>
-15328623718914
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>time NegativeGraphDiv1 < Example-4.txt</b></font>
-15328623718914
0.396u 0.004s 0:00.40 97.5%	0+0k 0+0io 0pf+0w
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

Example 4 is kind of a big one, but it doesn't max out the constraints.  I'll
have some in the gradescripts that do max out the constraints.

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>head -n 1 Example-4.txt</b></font>
40
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>sed -n 4p Example-4.txt | wc</b></font>
      1     442    2593
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>tail -n 1 Example-4.txt</b></font>
160743953
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

The gradescript <i>will</i> time your program, and you need to come in under two seconds
of user time when compiled with -O2.
<p>
I'm not testing your error checking.

This problem has three components to it, and they all have a Floyd-Warshall flavor to them.
<hr>
<h3>Part 1</h3>
This is the actual Floyd Warshall component.  Make an adjacency matrix out of the smallest
weight edges from each node to each other node (with zero-weight self-edges).  
Run Floyd-Warshall on that to create a 
matrix of shortest paths from every node to every other node.
Call this matrix S.  If <b>charges</b> equals 0, you can use this matrix to return the answer.
<p>
While you're at it, create an adjacency matrix that has the largest weight edges from every
node to every other node (zero if there is no edge).  Call that matrix L.

<p>
To help you, you can give an optional command line argument to my program (your program
does not have to do this).  If the argument is "P0", then the program will print out the
original adjacency matrix, and if it's "P1", then the program will print out S:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>mv a.out NegativeGraphDiv1</b></font>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 P0 < Example-0.txt</b></font>
   6000000         1         5
         1   6000000        10
         1         1   6000000
-9
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 P1 < Example-0.txt</b></font>
         0         1         5
         1         0         6
         1         1         0
-9
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<hr>

<h3>Part 2</h3>
Now create a new matrix, which we'll call A.  This is going to be a matrix of shortest path 
lengths from each node to each other node, where there is <i>exactly</i> one negative edge used.  
<p>
You make this by enumerating the following:
<UL>
<LI> For every starting node f.
<LI> For every ending node t;
<LI> For every intemediate starting node i;
<LI> For every intemediate ending node j:
</UL>
Consider the path f->i, (i,j), j->t, where the length of f->i and j->t come from S, and 
(i,j) is the longest edge from i to j (in L), multiplied by -1 to make it negative.
Set A[f][t] to be the shortest of these for all i and j.
<p>
You can give my executable the argument "P2" to see my A matrix:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 P2 < Example-0.txt</b></font>
        -8        -8        -9
        -9        -9       -10
        -8        -8        -9
-9
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<p>
<hr>

<h3>Part 3</h3>

Now, you want to create a matrix <i>A<sub>charges</sub></i> for an 
arbitrary value of <i>charges</i>.  <i>A<sub>charges</sub></i> is going to be the matrix of shortest paths from <i>f</i> to <i>t</i> that have exactly <i>charges</i> negative
edges.  If you have <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>A<sub>j</sub></i>, and <i>x</i> equals <i>i+j</i>, then you can 
make <i>A<sub>x</sub></i> from <i>A<sub>i</sub></i> and <i>A<sub>j</sub></i>.  You do that by considering all paths 
from <i>f</i> to <i>z</i> (using <i>A<sub>i</sub></i>) and <i>z</i> to <i>t</i> (using <i>A<sub>j</sub></i>) for every possible intermediate
node <i>z</i>.
<p>
Given that, you should be able to make any arbitrary 
<i>A<sub>x</sub></i> in <i>O(log x)</i> time. 
<p>
If you give my executable "P3", it will print the final 
<i>A<sub>charges</sub></i> matrix.  I won't show this on Example 0, since <i>charges</i> equals
1 there.  Here's example 2:

<pre>
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 P0 < Example-2.txt</b></font>
   6000000         1
         4   6000000
-9
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 P1 < Example-2.txt</b></font>
         0         1
         4         0
-9
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 P2 < Example-2.txt</b></font>
        -3        -6
        -4        -3
-9
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b>NegativeGraphDiv1 P3 < Example-2.txt</b></font>
       -10        -9
        -7       -10
-9
UNIX> <font color=darkred><b></b></font>
</pre>

<hr>
I don't know if you have analyzed running times yet, but Part 1 is 
<i>O(N<sup>3</sup>)</i>, 
Part 2 is 
<i>O(N<sup>4</sup>)</i>, 
and Part 3 is
<i>O(N<sup>3</sup>log(charges))</i>.
